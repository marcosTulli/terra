Keep planting new seeds until your mind becomes the Earth that gives birth to new worlds. 🌱We are @seedsoflove_sb 🌿🌱💚



We were thoughtfully planted on Earth with gentleness and we grew to respect our Mother and every living thing. We are the Earth keepers, the guardians of Sacred Medicine and we are here to bloom into kindness and keep spreading sympathy, selflessness, tolerance, generosity through the next generations.
We are Seeds of Love 🌱 @seedsoflove_sb MY heart exploded 😍
SUMMERCAMP2021. See you



🌱Seeds of Love 🌱 Nature-based Early Learning. My happy place @seedsoflove_sb 🌲🌻🦋☀️ Summer Camp 2021 at Skofield Park was so magical ✨and I can’t describe how grateful I am to be with these amazing lil humans. Being outdoors, learning through our senses, exploring and creating a space where we embrace the importance of nature connection, respect for all living things and compassion to one another. My heart is full so full 🌍🌻🌲🌱🌿💚


This is one of the most common questions we get from prospective families. Our answer: we play!

Rainy days are a highlight of the program. We have a tried and true rainy day protocol that includes setting up a rain shelter for cozy breaks, splashing in puddles, taking rain walks, making mud pies, making popcorn and sipping warm tea, and lots of muddy silliness 💦

Another aspect of rainy days is celebration! We give thanks to Sister Rain for filling our streams, reservoirs, lakes, quenching the dry earth and nourishing the plants 🌱 Gratitude is a constant theme at SOL and we are so grateful for the many blessings brought by the rain 🙏🏻

We hope you can get out and splash in some puddles or play in some snow during these winter storms 💙
